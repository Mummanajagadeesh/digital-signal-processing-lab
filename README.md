# digital-signal-processing-lab

This DSP MATLAB repository contains implementations of core digital signal processing experiments performed in dsp lab. It includes programs for basic signal operations, discrete-time convolution (both manual and built-in), circular convolution, linear convolution using zero-padding, overlap-add and overlap-save methods, DFT and IDFT using both DIT and DIF FFT algorithms, analog and digital filter designs (Butterworth and Chebyshev, LPF/HPF/BPF/BSF) using bilinear and impulse invariant transformations, FIR filter design using various window techniques, and sampling theorem demonstrations. Each script focuses on illustrating theoretical DSP concepts through clear MATLAB implementations and visual verification using plots and numerical outputs
